## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture

![Architecture diagram](asset/arch.jpg)

The main architecture of code based on MVI + CLEAN architecture. The division criteria is a hybrid strategy based on Feature + Layer by module.
For the detail of architecture, please read [this article](https://medium.com/@kaaveh/migrate-from-mvvm-to-mvi-f938c27c214f).
